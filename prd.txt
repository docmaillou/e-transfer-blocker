PRD: E-Transfer Blocker App (Desktop)

Purpose To protect users from making unauthorized or impulsive e-transfers on their personal computer by actively blocking, monitoring, and restricting any attempt to initiate an e-transfer transaction through banking websites, banking apps, or other online financial platforms.

Problem Statement Users may accidentally or impulsively send e-transfers on their PC, which can result in fraud, financial mistakes, or unapproved spending. There is currently no dedicated app to restrict or control e-transfer operations on a personal computer.

Goals ✅ Block any attempt to initiate an e-transfer on a PC ✅ Allow customizable settings to whitelist specific, approved transfers if needed ✅ Provide a secure admin override option ✅ Maintain a log of blocked attempts for transparency ✅ Operate with minimal system resource usage ✅ Ensure tamper-resistance so the user cannot easily disable it

Features 4.1 Blocking Capabilities Intercepts network traffic or browser requests to known banking portals

Detects patterns consistent with e-transfer initiation (e.g., known URL patterns, form field submissions)

Terminates or blocks the page/process if an e-transfer is detected

4.2 Notifications Instant pop-up to inform the user that an e-transfer attempt has been blocked

Optional email notification to the user or a trusted contact

4.3 Whitelisting Admin can whitelist specific recipient accounts or banking sites under strict conditions

All whitelisting is password-protected with optional multi-factor authentication

4.4 Logs Keeps a secure, encrypted log of:

Date/time of attempted e-transfer

Site/application involved

Amount attempted (if detected)

Log is only viewable with admin rights

4.5 Override Controls Override feature requiring a secure PIN, password, or biometric

Can optionally enforce a cooldown period before allowing overrides

Alerts trusted contacts if an override is used

4.6 Security Application hard to uninstall without master password

Encrypted settings

Obfuscation to prevent tampering

Non-Functional Requirements Compatible with Windows (initially)
Low CPU and RAM footprint

Uses secure and up-to-date cryptography

Easy to install, but hard to remove without the proper credentials

Compliant with privacy regulations (no personal banking data stored beyond logs of blocked attempts)

User Stories ✅ As a user, I want to prevent myself from sending e-transfers on my PC so I can protect my finances. ✅ As an admin, I want to whitelist specific e-transfer transactions if needed so I don’t block legitimate use. ✅ As a security-conscious user, I want to be alerted when an override occurs so I can spot fraud.

Success Metrics 95% of attempted e-transfers successfully blocked

Zero unauthorized overrides

Minimal false positives (not blocking non-financial traffic)

User satisfaction above 4/5 in post-launch survey

Constraints Must support major Canadian banking portals (TD, RBC, Scotiabank, etc.)
Should not conflict with other antivirus or endpoint security

Should follow strict software security best practices

Roadmap ✅ Phase 1 – MVP
Basic blocking of e-transfer forms and known URLs

Basic override with password

✅ Phase 2 – Advanced security

Biometric support

Trusted contact notifications

✅ Phase 3 – Enterprise / Family mode

Centralized management of multiple PCs

Advanced reporting
